                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>Founded in 2009, the Boutique & Lifestyle Leaders Association (BLLA) is the voice of the world’s independent boutique and lifestyle hotels, small brands and boutique businesses.</p>
                <p>The association was founded in response to a demand for a collective voice for this fragmented industry. Today the association has members around the world. As the lifestyle industry sees an ever-increasing demand from discerning boutique-seeking clients, BLLA is primarily dedicated to creating greater economic success for independent business owners by helping them level the playing field against larger brands and chains.</p>
                <p>We have verified over 10,000 authentic boutique hotels around the world (following guidelines and categories listed here) and we are working with nearly 300 hotels closely with the BLLA-intensive program.</p>
